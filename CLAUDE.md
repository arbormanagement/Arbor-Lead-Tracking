# Arbor Lead Tracking — Project Context

Internal lead-tracking & ROI app for Arbor Management (tree service, Metro East IL —
Edwardsville + O'Fallon). WhatConverts-style. Single-tenant. Owner: Justin
(justin@arbor-mgmt.com). Companion to the `arbor-general` repo (business context + skills).

## What this app is
- **Native call tracking + DNI on Twilio** — we own the numbers, swap/forward/record/transcribe. Goal: replace CallRail.
- **Web/form tracking** via first-party `track.js` on arbor-mgmt.com.
- **Facebook lead-gen** via the MCP webhook.
- **ROI = attributed HousecallPro won-estimate revenue ÷ ad spend**, per source/campaign/location. Revenue event = a customer-approved (won) estimate, valued at the approved-option amount (`hcp_estimates`); completed jobs are still synced (`hcp_jobs`) for secondary completed/invoiced visibility.
- **Read path is DIRECT to each platform API** (decision 2026-06-26): a background sync needs clean typed data + reliability, so we don't route it through the LLM-oriented MCP gateway. All spend/revenue access is behind `lib/integrations` (`SpendProvider`/`RevenueProvider`) so any provider can be swapped — including back to an MCP-backed impl. The MCP client (`lib/mcp/client.ts`) is retained as an optional per-platform fallback.
- Direct providers: `lib/integrations/housecallpro.ts` (API key), `google-ads.ts` (OAuth refresh → GAQL searchStream), `facebook.ts` (Graph insights). Sync jobs in `lib/sync/{spend,hcp}.ts`, recorded in `sync_runs`; admin trigger `POST /api/sync/{spend|hcp}`, scheduled by the `cron` worker (`scripts/cron.ts`) hitting `GET /api/cron/{job}`.

## Stack & conventions
- Next.js App Router on **Railway** · Postgres (Neon or Railway) · Drizzle ORM (`casing: snake_case`).
- Two Railway services off one repo: `web` (`railway.json`) and `cron` (`railway.cron.json`,
  runs `scripts/cron.ts` — the schedule that replaced Vercel Cron). Migrations run as the
  web service's pre-deploy step (`npm run db:deploy`), NOT during `npm run build`.
  Runbook: `DEPLOY.md`. No serverless execution ceiling — `maxDuration` exports are inert.
- Money in **integer cents**; phones in **E.164** (`lib/phone.ts`); IDs are **ULIDs**.
- Env access only via `lib/env.ts` (validated). Never read `process.env` directly.
- DB client (`lib/db/client.ts`) is driver-switchable via `DB_DRIVER`: `pg` (default,
  long-lived node-postgres pool — supports the interactive txn Phase 4 DNI leasing needs)
  or `neon-http` (stateless HTTPS, for serverless/edge or TCP-blocked networks).
- Auth: HMAC-signed session cookie + scrypt password (`lib/auth.ts`); single admin from `ADMIN_EMAIL`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`. Middleware is a presence gate; the dashboard layout does the authoritative check.

## Key files
- `lib/db/schema.ts` — full data model (visitors, web_sessions, tracking_numbers, number_assignments, sources, campaigns, ad_spend, hcp_customers, hcp_jobs, leads, calls, form_submissions, facebook_leads, attributions, roi_daily, …).
- `app/api/twilio/voice/route.ts` — inbound call: resolve tracking number → assignment → source, spam check, persist call+lead, return forward TwiML. **Must respond <3s** — fallback-forwards on any error so no call is lost.
- `lib/mcp/client.ts` — `executeTool`/`executeTools` over MCP JSON-RPC.
- `lib/attribution/classify.ts` — click-id/utm/referrer → source key + DNI pool.

## Phases
1. Call tracking on **static** numbers (current scaffold). 2. HCP revenue + spend sync + ROI. 3. `track.js` web/form. 4. Pooled DNI. 5. FB leadgen + LSA + Deepgram transcription + spam. 6. CallRail decommission.

**Phase 6 lives in the `arbor-general` repo** — `callrail-migration/` (plan, number
inventory, transfer mechanics) plus a summary in that repo's CLAUDE.md. It is vendor and
account knowledge, not app documentation, so it sits where every session sees it. Two
things from it that constrain this codebase:

- **✅ Phase 6 cutover DONE 2026-08-08.** All 10 CallRail numbers transferred into Arbor's
  Twilio account and were configured; the website cut over the same day (Arbor-Website
  PR #14 removed `swap.js` **and** `data-shadow` in one deploy). **Shadow mode is over —
  `track.js` now calls `/api/dni/assign` and owns the displayed number.** Verified live:
  session-sticky leases, distinct numbers per visitor, `gclid` frozen onto the lease, and a
  test call to a leased pool number completing cleanly. Pool = the 5 transferred CallRail
  pool numbers; the 5 published numbers plus test line `+16184278164` are static.
- **⚠️ `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` must stay set on the Railway `web` service.** It was unset from
  the Railway migration until 2026-08-08, and because `/api/twilio/status` and
  `/api/twilio/recording` **fail CLOSED** (`sig === "unresolved"` → 403 in production;
  only `/voice` fails open), every status and recording callback was rejected and no
  recording was ever persisted. Calls still connected, so nothing surfaced in the app.
  **Diagnostic:** Twilio's Monitor Alerts API logs every non-2xx webhook response as error
  11200/15003 — `GET https://monitor.twilio.com/v1/Alerts?StartDate=…`. Railway logs showed
  nothing. Check it after any webhook or credential change; zero alerts is the pass
  condition.
- CallRail is **not cancelled** — recordings still need archiving, and the Google Ads + GA4
  conversion integrations still need rebuilding on the app's own actions. See
  `callrail-migration/conversion-signal-gate.md` in `arbor-general`.

## Defaults (Justin can change)
- v1 channels: calls + web forms + FB leadgen (SMS deferred).
- Call routing: office +16188368004 first (configurable).
- Attribution: last-touch default (first-touch toggle planned).
- CallRail history: start fresh.

## Watch-outs
- Twilio webhook idempotency on `twilio_call_sid`; Meta on `fb_leadgen_id`.
- IL/MO mixed-consent recording → recording notice is played to callers.
- E.164 normalization is load-bearing for lead↔HCP matching/ROI.
- Scheduled jobs are fire-and-log: a failed run is logged and retried on the next tick, so
  the syncs must stay idempotent + self-healing (rolling re-pulls) rather than assume a retry queue.
- Spend sync is self-healing (`lib/sync/spend.ts`): rolling 35-day re-pull (platforms restate) + automatic cold-start backfill reaching to each platform's earliest lead (≤365d — spend with no leads to match is deliberately not fetched), keyed `(platform, external_campaign_id, date)`. No manual backfills.
