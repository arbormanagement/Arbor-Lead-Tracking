# Arbor Lead Tracking — Project Context

Internal lead-tracking & ROI app for Arbor Management (tree service, Metro East IL —
Edwardsville + O'Fallon). WhatConverts-style. Single-tenant. Owner: Justin
(justin@arbor-mgmt.com). Companion to the `arbor-general` repo (business context + skills).

## What this app is
- **Native call tracking + DNI on Twilio** — we own the numbers, swap/forward/record/transcribe. Goal: replace CallRail.
- **Web/form tracking** via first-party `track.js` on arbor-mgmt.com.
- **Facebook lead-gen** via the MCP webhook.
- **ROI = attributed HousecallPro won-estimate revenue ÷ ad spend**, per source/campaign/location. Revenue event = a customer-approved (won) estimate, valued at the approved-option amount (`hcp_estimates`); completed jobs are still synced (`hcp_jobs`) for secondary completed/invoiced visibility.
- **Read path is DIRECT to each platform API** (decision 2026-06-26): a background sync needs clean typed data + reliability, so we don't route it through the LLM-oriented MCP gateway. All spend/revenue access is behind `lib/integrations` (`SpendProvider`/`RevenueProvider`) so any provider can be swapped — including back to an MCP-backed impl. The MCP client (`lib/mcp/client.ts`) is retained as an optional per-platform fallback.
- Direct providers: `lib/integrations/housecallpro.ts` (API key), `google-ads.ts` (OAuth refresh → GAQL searchStream), `facebook.ts` (Graph insights). Sync jobs in `lib/sync/{spend,hcp}.ts`, recorded in `sync_runs`; admin trigger `POST /api/sync/{spend|hcp}` (Inngest cron wired at deploy).

## Stack & conventions
- Next.js App Router on Vercel · Neon Postgres · Drizzle ORM (`casing: snake_case`).
- Money in **integer cents**; phones in **E.164** (`lib/phone.ts`); IDs are **ULIDs**.
- Env access only via `lib/env.ts` (validated). Never read `process.env` directly.
- DB client is Neon **HTTP** (`lib/db/client.ts`). Phase 4 DNI leasing needs an interactive txn → use a short-lived `Pool` there.
- Auth: HMAC-signed session cookie + scrypt password (`lib/auth.ts`); single admin from `ADMIN_EMAIL`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`. Middleware is a presence gate; the dashboard layout does the authoritative check.

## Key files
- `lib/db/schema.ts` — full data model (visitors, web_sessions, tracking_numbers, number_assignments, sources, campaigns, ad_spend, hcp_customers, hcp_jobs, leads, calls, form_submissions, facebook_leads, attributions, roi_daily, …).
- `app/api/twilio/voice/route.ts` — inbound call: resolve tracking number → assignment → source, spam check, persist call+lead, return forward TwiML. **Must respond <3s** — fallback-forwards on any error so no call is lost.
- `lib/mcp/client.ts` — `executeTool`/`executeTools` over MCP JSON-RPC.
- `lib/attribution/classify.ts` — click-id/utm/referrer → source key + DNI pool.

## Phases
1. Call tracking on **static** numbers (current scaffold). 2. HCP revenue + spend sync + ROI (Inngest). 3. `track.js` web/form. 4. Pooled DNI. 5. FB leadgen + LSA + Deepgram transcription + spam. 6. CallRail decommission.

## Defaults (Justin can change)
- v1 channels: calls + web forms + FB leadgen (SMS deferred).
- Call routing: office +16188368004 first (configurable).
- Attribution: last-touch default (first-touch toggle planned).
- CallRail history: start fresh.

## Watch-outs
- Twilio webhook idempotency on `twilio_call_sid`; Meta on `fb_leadgen_id`.
- IL/MO mixed-consent recording → recording notice is played to callers.
- E.164 normalization is load-bearing for lead↔HCP matching/ROI.
- MCP is a hard dependency for spend/revenue — use Inngest retries + rolling re-pulls.
- Spend sync is self-healing (`lib/sync/spend.ts`): rolling 35-day re-pull (platforms restate) + automatic cold-start backfill reaching to each platform's earliest lead (≤365d — spend with no leads to match is deliberately not fetched), keyed `(platform, external_campaign_id, date)`. No manual backfills.
